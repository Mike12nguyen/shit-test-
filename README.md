# Kali VNC Docker Container

This repo contains a Docker setup to run Kali Linux with KasmVNC, providing remote access to a Kali desktop environment.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Build the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t kali-vnc .
```

### üåê Step 2: Deploy to the Cloud

Since GitHub doesn‚Äôt provide infrastructure for running Docker containers directly, you'll need to deploy the container to a cloud provider. Here are some options to make this accessible remotely (even at school):

#### üöÄ Option 1: Deploy to **DockerHub** + **VPS** (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)

1. **Push the Docker image to DockerHub**:
   - Build the image locally first.
   - Create a DockerHub account and push the image to your account:
     ```bash
     docker tag kali-vnc <your-dockerhub-username>/kali-vnc:latest
     docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/kali-vnc:latest
     ```

2. **Deploy on a cloud VPS**:
   - Set up a cloud VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, or any VPS provider).
   - SSH into your VPS and pull the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker pull <your-dockerhub-username>/kali-vnc:latest
     ```

3. **Run the container**:
   - Run the Docker container on the VPS, exposing port 6901:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 6901:6901 --name kali-vnc <your-dockerhub-username>/kali-vnc:latest
     ```

4. **Access the container**:  
   - Open your browser and go to the VPS's public IP address, e.g., `http://<your-vps-ip>:6901`.
   - You should now be able to log in via the KasmVNC interface.

---

#### üöÄ Option 2: Deploy to **Cloud Platforms** like **Railway.app** or **Fly.io**

1. **Push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**:
   - If you‚Äôre using GitHub Actions to automate things, you can set up a **CI/CD pipeline** to automatically build and deploy to GHCR.

2. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Railway is a platform that allows you to deploy Docker containers quickly and easily.
   - Create an account on [Railway](https://railway.app/), link your GitHub repo, and deploy the container using their simple interface.
   - Railway will expose the ports for you, and you can access the app via a public URL.

### üéì Step 3: Access from School

Once deployed, you can access your Kali Linux container through the **web interface** (provided by KasmVNC):

1. Open your browser.
2. Go to the public IP or URL where your container is running (e.g., `http://<your-vps-ip>:6901` or the Railway/Fly.io URL).
3. Log in using the credentials you‚Äôve set up (default username/password as per KasmVNC).

---

### üìå Extra Considerations:

- **Security**: If you plan to access the container from school, make sure that you secure the setup (use passwords and possibly VPNs or other protection).
- **Performance**: Running in the cloud (VPS, Railway, Fly.io, etc.) should give you more power than running it locally or on Codespaces.
- **Persistence**: Make sure your container's data persists between restarts (either using Docker volumes or another mechanism).

---

### TL;DR:

- **Publish** your Docker setup on GitHub (Dockerfile, `docker-compose.yml`).
- **Deploy** it on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean or Railway.
- **Access** the container via the web using the public IP or provided URL.
